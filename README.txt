Elementary version of the Search Binary Algorithm. Re-created in Python. 

In order to use the function in your script.py 

  1) Have the file open on your code editor. 
  
  2) Use the syntax, from Elementary_Search_Binary_Algorithm import search_binary
  
  Syntax to use the function:
  
  object = search_binary(lst, a number you want to find) 
  
  **Example can be found on Test_inputs.py** 
  
  
The function returns the index at which the element is at, and the element itself.

**If you run Test_inputs.py while having Elementary_Search_Binary_Algorithm open, you will see it return the element and the index.**
